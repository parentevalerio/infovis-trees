# Infovis individual project

This project is developed as part of the Information Visualization course.
The aim is to visualize data in the form of stylized trees, where each component of the tree (roots, trunk, crown, and fruits) represents a distinct data. When a user clicks on any of these components, the ten trees reposition themselves in an increasing order based on the data associated with the clicked component.
